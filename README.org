* Getting Started
This section of the README is dedicated to setting up the dots.
These instructions will be at [[./install.fish]]

** Setting Up the Repo
First, to get access to the files, so you can install this, clone the repo with git clone

** Delete the Current Configuration Files
**DISCLAIMER** THIS IS DANGEROUS, MAKE SURE TO BACKUP ALL OF YOUR CONFIGURATION FILES

#+begin_src shell
sudo chmod +x bin/delete-kde-configuration-files.fish

/usr/bin/env fish bin/delete-kde-configuration-files.fish
#+end_src

** Run the Sync and Setup Scripts
The Sync Script will make symlinks in your home directory and the Setup Script will create symlinks outside of the home directory for some specific files.
It is not needed to run the Sync Script AND the Setup Script as the Sync Script already runs the setup script.

But first, make sure you have the KDE Compositor disabled:
Go to System Settings > Hardware > Display and Monitor > Compositor and tick the 'Enable on Startup' option off:

[[./.imgs/compositor.png]]

#+begin_src shell
# make sure you are in the dotfiles directory:
cd ~/.dotfiles/

# make sure you have the permissions for it
sudo chmod +x bin/sync-dotfiles.sh

# run it
./bin/sync-dotfiles
#+end_src

Log out and Login again.

** Enabling the Emacs Service
So you can use the Emacs Client, you need to start the Emacs Daemon / Server. To do that, run this command:

#+begin_src shell
systemctl --user enable emacs.service --now
#+end_src

Now press Super + Shift + E and BAM! An Emacs Client
